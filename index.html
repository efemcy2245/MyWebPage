  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I have a strong inner drive to learn and master every aspect of the job—
    what I would describe as an internal hunger, an endless source of motivation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy diving deep into topics and learning independently to build broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find some of my projects at the following link:
    <a href="https://github.com/efemoy2245" target="_blank">https://github.com/efemoy2245</a>.
    Over the past month, I’ve taken the time to organize my thoughts on several key topics.
    I’ve shared what I’ve learned by publishing my insights and perspectives.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a great opportunity for me—not only to demonstrate what I’m capable of,
    but also to leave a piece of myself in the work.
