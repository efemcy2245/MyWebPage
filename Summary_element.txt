  <!-- 
  Meta  Metadata is data about the document that is not displayed 
  on the page but is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services.
  
  name="viewport" - Tells the browser that the metadata in the content attribute
                   is related to the viewport — the user's visible area of a web page.
  
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" 
  width=device-width    Sets the width of the viewport to be equal to the device’s screen width.
                        This ensures the layout adjusts properly on different screen sizes (phones, tablets, desktops).
  initial-scale=1       Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
  Why It's Important:
  Without this tag, mobile browsers might scale your page down to fit a default width (often 980px), 
  making content tiny and unreadable.
  With this tag, the layout becomes fluid and adaptable to different screen sizes, 
  which is essential for a mobile-friendly and responsive website.

(as in this case) or an absolute URL (e.g., https://...).
