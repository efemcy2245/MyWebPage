    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
    I have a strong inner drive to learn and master every aspect of the job—what I would describe as an internal hunger, an endless source of motivation. I enjoy diving deep into topics and learning independently to build broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge. You can find some of my projects at the following link:

    </a>.
    Over the past month, I’ve taken the time to organize my thoughts on several key topics. I’ve shared what I’ve learned by publishing my insights and perspectives.
    This is a great opportunity for me—not only to demonstrate what I’m capable of, but also to leave a piece of myself in the work.
